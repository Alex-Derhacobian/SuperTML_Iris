# SuperTML_Iris
This is an original implementation of the SuperTML method outlined in the paper "SuperTML: Two-Dimensional Word Embedding for the Precognition on Structured Tabular Data" by Sun et. al. 

It transforms a tabular machine learning task into a computer vision task by embedding tabular data onto blank black images. Results show state of the art performance, with 96.67% accuracy on the Iris dataset.
